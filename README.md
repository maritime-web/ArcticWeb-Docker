# ArcticWeb Docker
A dockerized container for the ArcticWeb project. The container deploys the latest successful build of ArcticWeb on a Wildfly 8.2.0 web server. It also has the required CouchDB and MySQL as described in the [ArcticWeb](https://github.com/maritime-web/ArcticWeb#arcticweb) guide. 

## Prerequisties
* Docker 1.10.0+
* Docker Compose 1.6.0+
* A file called arcticweb.properties

## Initial Setup
Clone the repository to a choosen directory using

    $ git clone https://github.com/maritime-web/ArcticWeb-Docker.git

In your home directory you need to make two new directories - 'properties' and 'arcticCouch'. The latter needs to have the subdirectory 'couchdb/etc/etc/local.d'.
In the 'properties' directory you should put the 'arcticweb.properties' file, and in 'arcticCouch' in the former specified subdirectory you should put the configuration files for the CouchDB.

Then build the container using Docker Compose

    $ docker-compose build

To start the container execute the following command
    
    $ docker-compose up

On subsequent startups you can start the container with either

    $ docker-compose up

Or

    $ docker-compose start
